src/backtest_engine/portfolio_layer/allocation/allocator.py

Capital allocation and contract sizing for the portfolio backtester.

Responsibility: Given total equity, strategy weights, signals, and recent
price history, compute TargetPosition quantities for each (slot, symbol) pair
using volatility-targeting methodology.

Methodology (per slot, per symbol):
    1.  slot_equity        = total_equity * slot.weight
    2.  instrument_vol     = annualised rolling stddev of close-to-close returns
                             over the last vol_lookback_bars bars.
    3.  annual_dollar_risk = slot_equity * target_portfolio_vol
    4.  contract_dollar_vol = instrument_vol * price * multiplier
    5.  raw_contracts      = annual_dollar_risk / contract_dollar_vol
    6.  contracts          = round(raw_contracts)
    7.  contracts          = min(contracts, max_contracts_per_slot)
    8.  signed_qty         = contracts * signal.direction

The key denominator is the annualised dollar volatility of one full contract:
`annualised_vol * price * multiplier`. Tick size is relevant for execution and
slippage simulation, but it is not the correct denominator for volatility-
targeted contract sizing.
